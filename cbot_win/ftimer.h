/// @brief A fast (msec) timer based on system multimedia timer.
/// The win multimedia timer is erratic. Using a one msec tick (fastest), the measured interval is +-100 us.
/// Also note that it takes about 10 ticks to settle down after start.
/// This component attempts to reduce the error by running at one msec and managing the requested periods manually.
/// This is accomplished by using a Stopwatch to actually measure the elapsed time rather than trust the mm timer period.
/// It seems to be an improvement.
