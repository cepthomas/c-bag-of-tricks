# c-bag-of-tricks
A collection of the C (and a bit of C++) things I seem to use repeatedly.

No dependencies on third party components.

It is plain C99 so should build and run on any win or nx platform using any compiler.
A Qt Creator/QMake project using mingw is supplied (no Qt libs in output).

It makes use of my standby unit tester [pnut](https://github.com/cepthomas/pnut).

# state-machine

- Generates diagrams via dot.
- See test-sm.cpp/lock.c for an example of usage.

# list
- A simple doubly-linked list so we can have some rudimentary collections in C.
- See test-list.cpp for examples.
